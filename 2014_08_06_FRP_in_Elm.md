#FRP in Elm

1. What is FRP
2. What is Elm
3. Project outline
4. Initial difficulties
    a. collision detection
    b. Switching characters
        - pushing to character list
        - setting active character
    c. Scrolling the background.

*Caveat emptor - What follows describes my first attempt at developing a game. I'm sure that it doesn't necessarily follow best practices, as I really hit the ground running and learned-by-doing. This is meant to be less a HOW-TO than a HOW-I-DID-IT.*

#FRP
To provide somethin of a circular definition, Functional Reactive Programming is reactive programming using a functional language. FRP allows one to write functional, high-level code that reacts to inputs that change over time (*e.g* time itself, key-presses, or mouse-clicks). These events are typically referred to as *Signals*. This allows one to write pure functions that can be lifted to work on and return Signals themselves.

#Elm
<a src="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> is a functional language designed for creating reactive applications in the browser. Its design and syntax were influenced by Haskell, OCaml, SML, and F#. Elm compiles to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In Elm, functions are pure and values immutable, but lifting functions to work on Signals allows them to change over time based on *Signals*.

I had seen Elm mentioned a number of times on the <a src="http://reddit.com/r/haskell">Haskell subreddit</a> over the past year or so. I always thought it looked interesting, but I didn't really have any projects that I wanted to try it in. When I was younger, I always wanted to make videogames. Lately that itch has been resurfacing and I've been wanting to finally give game programming a shot. I thought this would be the perfect opportunity to get my feet wet with both FRP and Elm. 

###The Plan
At the time I started experimenting, I didn't have a plan. I wanted to make a game, but beyond that, I didn't know what. I went to Elm's <a src="http://elm-lang.org">homepage</a> and looked at the examples that are posted there (highly recommended by the way, esp. the Pong and Mario examples). Using the online editor, I loaded the examples side-by-side with the code and read through it until I thought I understood what things did. Then, with the documentation open in another window, I tried changing the code. Things broke and I attempted to fix them, all the while making slight modifications.

After playing around for a while and getting a grasp on the syntax and standard library, I had the idea to try making a small single-level platformer. A recent game that I really enjoyed is <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/220780/">Thomas Was Alone</a>. In Thomas Was Alone, the player controls a group of rectangles through puzzle/platformer levels. Elm has great built in support for graphics, and among the simplest things to draw to the screen is a rectangle, so I decided that I'd make a prototype platformer homage to Thomas Was Alone. I'm affectionately calling it Thomas Was A Clone.

###Game Setup
The recommended setup for a game in Elm has four components:
<ol>
    <li>Input - defines the *Signals* that will affect the game. Among others, these can be mouse-clicks, key-presses, or the passage of time.</li>
    <li>Model - describes the basic elements of the game, *e.g.* characters, levels, enemies, items, etc....</li>
    <li>Update - define functions that act on items from the model. By lifting these to work on *Signals*, they can update the items based on the previously defined inputs.</li>
    <li>Display - defines how to render everything to the screen.</li>
